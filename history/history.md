# The History of Nothing
Once upon a time, in the beginning of 2009, there was Bitcoin and a couple of Bitcoin blocks floated on internet and nobody cared! But now it's a king!... later on, in January of 2021 (at block 666,050 to be exact) the Stacks 2.0 blockchain came into existence from a Bitcoin sperm. A network to build a better internet, owned by the users on the top of Bitcoin blockchain!... A while later, a notion stroke into someone's head that why state's money should matters at all?! And what distinguishes money from nothing?! While spiritualist say money is literally nothing, could nothing become money in reverse?!

## Nothing(42) and Micro-Nothing ($MNO)

Nothing(42) is the first fungible-token that was created on the Stacks network. Micro-Nothing with the $MNO ticker is the final iteration that was created by the founders with a total supply of 100,000,000,000,000 Micro-Nothing. The contract for MNO was created in block #5235, anchored to bitcoin block 672454. The five founding addresses mined the total supply. And those will be shared among stacks community members, starting at the end of February 2021, with the first 20 Trillion.

## Wrapped MNO

The Nothing token (MNO) was created before the standard for Fungible Tokens on Stacks was finalized and that is why yet another Nothing contract was devised. The Wrapped Nothing contract will wrap your MNO and create WMNO in its stead. WMNO does adhere to the FT-standard and will make it possible to easily interact with other contracts in the future. 

## The Nothing token is a meme coin anchored to bitcoin

The Nothing token is a meme coin, it is encouraged to make memes about this coin and post them on social media (mention #MNOtoken on twitter). Every week one winner will be elected and they receive a billion Nothing tokens. Nothing is for everyone in the stacks community, you can get some at nothingtoken.com, you can receive it from other NoBroâ€™s (= anyone who's got Nothing) and gift it to anyone with a Stacks address. Since Nothing is worth Nothing they can be mindlessly used for tests on the Stacks mainnet. Have fun; loading up on Nothing, wrapping and unwrapping Nothing (**need speed-spend page for that: link here**), sending 1337 Nothing to a fresh miner address and drewling over a million Nothing in your Boom Wallet... like it is Nothing!
