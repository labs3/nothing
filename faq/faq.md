# Frequently asked questions

**Why was Nothing created?**

To show that even fun and joy could be more trustable value comparing to states fiat moneys?... And because it could be!

Later someone commented: _We made a shitcoin on stx first, you can get that freely at nothingtoken.com so you don't have to make one yourself or get scammed to buy any._ which is also true, Nothing was made in service of the stx community. 

**Why is it called Nothing?**

Nothing with capital "N" is actually something! Well it is not called Nothing because it is nothing. It is called Nothing to make it a formidable meme coin. Often in the world of cryptographic coins these coins are valued higher than any fiat currency because fiat currency nowadays are backed by nothing. Nothing is better than that because it is immutable! No more than 100 Trillion MNO will ever exist in the world. You know this to be true because it is anchored to the most immutable blockchain on the planet: Bitcoin. And hence the punchline; Nothing is more immutable then your mama™.

**How can I transfer Nothing?**

Nothing(MNO) is supported by the Hiro Web Wallet and the Boom Wallet as of March 2021. Wrapped Nothing is supported by the Hiro Web Wallet and will be supported by any wallet and exchange in the future that supports fungible tokens that adhere to the FT-standard (SIP-010) on Stacks.

**Why are there several versions of the Nothing contract?**

Testing was done on Mainnet… you should really test contracts on testnet because everything you create on the mainnet is immutable. We learned this lesson for you, feel free to thank us later by testing your own contracts on testnet or your private mocknet first ;-)

In the current contract Nothing is called Wrapped Nothing and although the contract was deployed on Stacks 2.0 on March 11th it wasn’t until the end of March before the first ~18 Trillion MNO was wrapped to create WMNO for distribution by the Nothing faucet at nothingtoken.com.

**Can I mint xUSD using WMNO as collateral?**

xUSD is a stablecoin on Stacks soft-pegged to the USD: minted at the Crypto/Defi bank: Arkadiko. ****In theory Arkadiko supports WMNO tokens or any other token that adheres to the SIP010 standard for fungible tokens (FT). By the March 2021 calculation you would need an infinite amount of Nothing to mint one xUSD ;-)
